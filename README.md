# Intro

This library exports a function `getQuery` which takes a JSON query and returns an Postgres SQL query to retrieve nested data in JSON form.

# JSON Query

Here is an example of a JSON query

```javascript
  {
    table_name: {
      fields: {
        'id': 'sample_id'
      },
      children: other_table,
      conditionString: 'example_number = 1',
      conditions: { boolean_field: true, number_field: '> 5' },
    }
  }
```
# Description
  
  'table_name' - is the name of the table querying

  'children' - is an embedded query neste under the current table

  'conditions' - contains field keys with values that the field 
                  should equal. A leading '=' is implied if an
                  operator is not specified.

  'conditionString' - raw unprocessed condition.

# CLI Tool

This package provides a CLI in `bin` directory that takes JSON6 file as a query and writes and Postgres SQL query to STDIN.
