# Intro

This library exports a function `getQuery` which takes a data-structure as query and returns an Postgres SQL query to retrieve nested data in JSON form.

# JSON Query

Here is an example of a JSON query

```json
  {
    "table_name": {
      "fields": {
        "id": "table_id"
      },
      "children": {
        "other_table": {
          "fields": {
            "id": "other_id"
          }
        }
      },
      "conditionString": "example_number = 1",
      "conditions": { "boolean_field": true, "number_field": "> 5" }
    }
  }
```
# Description
  
  `table_name` - is the name of the table querying

  `children` - is an embedded query neste under the current table

  `conditions` - contains field keys with values that the field 
                  should equal. A leading '=' is implied if an
                  operator is not specified.

  `conditionString` - raw unprocessed condition.

# Example

```javascript

import getQuery from 'pg-nested-json-query'

const page_contents = {
  page_content: {
    name: 'contents',
    fields: {
      id: 'page_content_id',
      name: 'page_content_name',
    }
  }
}

const query = {
  pages: {
    fields: {
      id: 'page_id',
      name: 'page_name',
    },
    children: page_contents,
    conditions: { active: true },
  },
  galleries: {
    fields: {
      id: 'gallery_id',
      name: 'gallery_name',
    },
    conditions: { active: true}
  } 
}


console.log( getQuery( query ) )


```

Output

```sql

select json_build_object(
  'pages', array(
    select json_build_object(
      'id', pages.page_id,
      'name', pages.page_name,
      'contents', array(
        select json_build_object(
          'id', page_content.page_content_id,
          'name', page_content.page_content_name
        ) from page_content where page_content.page_content_id = pages.page_id
      )
    ) from pages where pages.active = true
  ),
  'galleries', array(
    select json_build_object(
      'id', galleries.gallery_id,
      'name', galleries.gallery_name
    ) from galleries where galleries.active = true
  )
)

```
# CLI Tool

This package provides a CLI in `bin` directory that can accept either a JSON, JSON6, or YAML file as a query and writes and Postgres SQL query to STDIN.

Example use

`npx pg-nested-json-query web-query.yaml | psql database > web-data.json`

Here is the help screen for CLI tool

```
Usage

  pg-nested-json-query query-file [options]

Options

  --file file       This is the default option and can be omitted.
  --type, -t type   Declare file format. Either "yaml", "json" or "json6".
